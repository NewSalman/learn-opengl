# current update 2/17/25

1. Camera new render per scene
2. Camera UBO/ Uniform Buffer Object done
3. Adding Light UBO to World Scene
	- Light position updated with ubo rather then update uniform matrix
4. fix Light Object on world scene, when i update camera UBO Key to CameraBlock but in Light vertex shader still old "Matrices"
5. Mouse and Keyboard input handle from abstract class Scene

next planned update
1. Add lightning material to Cylinder
2. Add a sky block for nicer view
3. Set Material texture with downloaded texture image "Concret"
4. Make an Arch 
5. Learn to make an Toroid/Torus to make an arch
6. Make shader dynamic
	- add file for header for #version 
	- add in/out 
	- add Unifrom Buffer binding
	- add the object calculation
	- merge it into one
	- make sure the offset of each properties are correct

	//LightningShader.SetVec3("lightPos", lightPosition);
    //LightningShader.SetVec3("viewPos", _camera.Position);

# Last Update on 2/17/25
1. Lightning still showing black
2. uniform buffer specular it's just showing black even the color should't be white or black

==============================================================================================

update on 2/19/25

1. Bug on stride or size of buffer on Vertice_normals_texture_coordinates should be 8 * sizeof(float) not 9 * sizeof(float)
2. i dont know why, i dont have to normalize normals again on the fragment shader based on input from vertex shader
3. adding concrete texture to cylinder object
4. cylinder object mimic gold material done
5. Height of cylinder not using the cylinder class property bcuz debug error from preview learning
6. uniform have to used in fragment (maybe on vertex to) or it will return error without any message
